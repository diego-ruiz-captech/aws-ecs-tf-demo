# AWS ECS Terraform Demos

- [ECS, EC2, ALB Demo](ecs-ec2-alb/README.md)
- [Simple ECS Fargate Demo](ecs-fargate/README.md)

## Todo

- Ensure ecs containers can connect to aws resources (ie. s3, rds)
- Ensure ecs containers can communicate with each other
- Review and tune with security best practices
- Link up with CI/CD resources for ECS deployments
- Submit demos to aws terraform ecs community module (they're still lacking fully fleshed out [examples](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ecs/tree/master/examples/complete-ecs))
